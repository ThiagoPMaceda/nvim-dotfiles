## Neovim Configs

These are my files from my neovim config, I have iterated a bunch over time with my config but for now, I started using the [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) config since it offers sane defaults and I feel like I understand what is happening in my config. When I used configs like NvChad, I thought I was adding a lot of stuff that I did not fully utilize.
